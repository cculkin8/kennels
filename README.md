To run Kennels please run "npm install" in the base of the repository. You will also need to go into the "kennels-api" folder and remove the .example from the end of the json file I have left in there for you to run. 

Once you have done both of these things you will be ready to run kennels! All you need to do is run "npm start" from the base repository and run "json-server -p 5002 -w database.json" from the kennels-api folder.

Once everything is done and you're running the project I would recommend logging in and viewing the different tabs that are available (Animals, Locations, Employees, and Owners.)

If you have any questions please reach out to me!
